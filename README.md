# **üéØ Project Motivation** <a name="Project-Motivation"></a>

Every student juggles competing priorities, stemming from school, work and personal life. CogniEdu takes the planning out of these priorities and creates an optimized schedule, tailored according to a user‚Äôs preferences, skills and commitments. With CogniEdu, students have a dedicated partner in Ed, a conversational AI chatbot as they navigate through their academic journey. Ed assists with organizing tasks, sending out reminders, answering questions about their calendar and classes, and helping students be more successful with their academics.

### üìã Onboarding Experience <a name="Onboarding-Experience"></a>
Each user undergoes an onboarding experience that integrates their calendar and academic platform through API calls. During this process, users complete an onboarding questionnaire that Ed uses to learn about their study habits and academic preferences. This information allows Ed to personalize the planning experience according to each user‚Äôs needs. 

### üì•  Accessing Data through API Integration <a name="Accessing-Data"></a>  
Student data accessed via API to access calendar information.                                                

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Management with SQL <a name="Database"></a> 
Upon user signup, the onboarding questionnaire populates the users table in MySQL. By integrating with the user‚Äôs Google account, the application continuously syncs their Google Calendar event data with the MySQL database. Additionally, assignment information, such as due dates and instructions, is extracted from Google Classroom, transformed, and loaded into the MySQL database. The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application then leverages this comprehensive data set to provide personalized and optimized solutions.                                                

### üïõ Time Estimations by LLM for Optimizer Algorithm <a name="Time"></a> 
Text

### üóìÔ∏è Optimized Scheduling via Heuristics and LLM Prompting <a name="Optimizing"></a> 
Leveraging Gemini‚Äôs advanced reasoning capabilities, our application generates a study schedule based on specified study durations (e.g., 2 hours, 4 hours). These durations are processed through a greedy heuristic optimization algorithm, which considers the student's availability and preferences. The algorithm strategically places these study sessions at optimal times throughout the day. The outcome is a comprehensive schedule that seamlessly integrates the student‚Äôs personal events with the newly optimized study times.
                                           
### üí¨ Ed: Our Conversational AI RAG Application Utilizing Langraph <a name="Ed"></a> 
The chatbot leverages LangGraph's latest features to implement two powerful capabilities. The first is PDF Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), which accesses students' Google Classroom materials to provide efficient, relevant query results. The second feature enables conversational interaction with the student's calendar. These functionalities allow students to seamlessly query their course resources and manage their schedules through natural language conversations.

</p> 

### üîî Proactive Alerts for On Task Management <a name="Notifications"></a> 
Managing one's schedule effectively can often prove to be challenging. Ed sends proactive alerts to help users stay on track by extracting calendar data, formatting it into informative emails, automating the process, and securely integrating with external services via API calls and SSL for safe message transmission.


# üìä  Model Evaluation <a name="Model-Evaluation"></a>                                             
In selection of the model powering Ed, two models were compared, two of Google's Large Language Models were compared, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash, using LangChain and AI.

# üì± Streamlit Built User Interface <a name="Streamlit"></a>                                             
CogniEdu utilizes Streamlit alongside custom CSS to develop an intuitive user interface, ensuring a cohesive user experience. The deployment involved leveraging Cloud Run and NGROK to facilitate seamless accessibility and scalability of the data science application.

# **ü§î Technical Challenges** <a name="Technical-Challenges"></a>
#### 1. AI Hallucination: 
AI systms can produce hallucinations, generation misleading or incorrect information. In order to reduce hallucinations, we provided specific prompts, clear constraints, and relevant data sources to curate Ed's responses. 
#### 2. Privacy Concerns: 
Students provide student data from their emails, Google Calendar, and Google Classroom that need safeguarding
#### 3. Limited Training Data: 
Limited data given reliance on student data. We utilized generative AI (Chatgpt) to create synthetic data to test out our chatbot.
#### 4. Agentic System Run Time: 
Increase Complexity affects run time
#### 5. Agentic System Tool Selection: 
Implementing the correct logic for the agent to chose the right tool based on context
#### 6. LLM Inconsistency: 
LLM responses can be random or inconsistent

# üöÄ Future Work <a name="Future-Work"></a>  
#### 1. Robust Time Estimation
More robust time estimation algorithm for optimizer
#### 2. Scale Features
Each component can be scaled to accommodate more students and plan for longer time-periods
#### 3. Partnership
