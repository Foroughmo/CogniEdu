# **üéØ Project Motivation** <a name="Project-Motivation"></a>
<p align="center">
<img width="300" alt="Screenshot 2024-08-06 at 5 23 52‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d0c417e2-8c76-48de-a637-a6fc32184ce5">

The story begins with a hypothetical student, Nick Ramen. Nick, a college student, faces a common challenge: balancing the best college experience possible while maintaining good grades, a healthy sleep schedule, and a social life. However, he eventually overcommits and becomes overwhelmed, leading to a decline in grades and confusion on how to navigate his academic struggles.


<br> Like Nick, approximately 86% of college students face challenges in effectively managing their time, which can lead to procrastination, stress, and a decline in academic performance.<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>

**Here is how CogniEdu can help:**

CogniEdu simplifies the planning process by creating an optimized schedule tailored to the student‚Äôs preferences, skills, and commitments. With CogniEdu, students benefit from a dedicated AI Chatbot Assistant named Ed. Ed assists with organizing tasks, sending email reminders, answering questions about the calendar and classes, and supporting students in achieving academic success.

# üß© Project Components <a name="Project-Components"></a>

### üìã Onboarding Experience <a name="Onboarding-Experience"></a>
Each student undergoes an onboarding experience that integrates their calendar and academic platform through API calls. During this process, users complete an onboarding questionnaire that Ed uses to learn about their study habits and academic preferences. This information allows Ed to personalize the planning experience according to each student‚Äôs needs. 

<h5 align="center"> Onboarding </h5>
<p align="center">
<img width="485" alt="Onboarding" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/881a35f2-f323-4dc0-9331-21047dae264a">
</p>

### [üóÑÔ∏è Database Management with SQL](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/1_SQL_Database) <a name="Database"></a> 
Upon user signup, the onboarding questionnaire populates the student's table in MySQL. By integrating with the student's Google account, the application continuously syncs their Google Calendar event data with the MySQL database. 

<h5 align="center"> Calendar Sync Overview </h5>
<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="Calendar Sync Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e418f9e5-2097-46da-8a15-bf9c5570982d">
</p> 

The calendar sync involves an initial import of the student's full calendar, while the continuous sync regularly updates every X number of minutes. The sync also stores events and handles NEW, UPDATED, and DELETED items chunked and embedded for future retrieval, per a logic. 

<h5 align="center"> Calendar Sync Logic </h5>

<img width="400" alt="Calendar Sync Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69833ef1-ab3f-4bb3-8258-1be97508510e">
</p> 

The MySQL database also houses assignment information, such as due dates and instructions, which is extracted from Google Classroom, and then transformed, before being loaded into said database. The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application then leverages this comprehensive data set to provide personalized and optimized solutions.                                                
### [üïõ Time Estimations by LLM for Optimizer Algorithm](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/2_LLM_Time_Estimation) <a name="Time"></a> 

The time estimation algorithm serves as the preliminary phase in preparing data for the optimizer. This process is executed in two steps utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) through prompt engineering.

**Step 1: Assignment Difficulty Level**
The LLM evaluates the difficulty level of each assignment based on its content. Assignments are then categorized on a scale of easy, medium, or hard. These qualitative scales are converted into numerical values and stored accordingly.

**Step 2: Time Estimation**
Based on the assignment's content and its assigned difficulty level, the LLM estimates the time required to complete the assignment. Once the time estimation is determined, it is provided to the optimizer to create an optimized study plan.

<h5 align="center"> Time Estimation LLM </h5>

### [üóìÔ∏è Optimized Scheduling via Heuristics and LLM Prompting](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/3_Optimizer) <a name="Optimizing"></a> 
Leveraging Gemini‚Äôs advanced reasoning capabilities, our application generates a study schedule based on specified study durations (e.g., 2 hours, 4 hours). These durations are processed through a greedy heuristic optimization algorithm, which considers the student's availability and preferences. The algorithm strategically places these study sessions at optimal times throughout the day. The outcome is a comprehensive schedule that seamlessly integrates the student‚Äôs personal events with the newly optimized study times.

</p> 
                                           
### [üí¨ Ed: Our Conversational AI Agent](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/4_Chatbot) <a name="Ed"></a> 
CogniEdu's chatbot, Ed, is built on the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) paradigm, leveraging LangGraph to create a dynamic, multi-tool agent. The system employs three key capabilities:

1. PDF Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): This tool accesses and queries students' Google Classroom materials, providing efficient and relevant information from course documents.

2. Calendar Interaction: A dedicated tool enables conversational access to the student's personal and academic calendar, allowing for schedule queries and management.

3. Web Search Integration: Utilizing Tavily, the agent can fetch external resources to supplement course materials and provide additional learning support.

<h5 align="center"> ReAct Framework </h5>
<p align="center">
<img width="267" alt="ReAct Framework" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb2feec-ee06-4b08-adfd-99872d1d76db">
</p> 

Ed processes user queries through an iterative cycle of reasoning (using a Large Language Model) and acting (employing these specialized tools). This ReAct architecture allows the agent to break down complex queries, determine the most appropriate tools to use, and synthesize information from multiple sources. By integrating these functionalities, students can seamlessly query their course resources, manage their schedules, and access relevant external content through natural language conversations. The LangGraph framework enables Ed to maintain context and make informed decisions throughout these interactions, enhancing the overall user experience and academic support.

<h5 align="center"> Ed's Pipeline </h5>
<p align="center">

### [üîî Proactive Alerts for On Task Management](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/5_Email_Notification) <a name="Notifications"></a> 
Managing one's schedule effectively can often prove to be challenging. Ed sends email notifications with optimized calendar information to help users stay on track by extracting calendar data, formatting it into informative emails, and automating the process. Emails are securely sent by integrating with external email servers via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for safe message transmission.

In selection of the model powering Ed, two models were compared, two of Google's Large Language Models were compared, Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash, using LangChain and AI.

### [CogniEdu App Overview](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/blob/main/8_Streamlit/App_Overview/app.md) <a name="CogniEdu-App-Overview"></a>

CogniEdu can be broken down into two process flows:

1. New Students: New students will complete an onboarding process to set up their profile with CogniEdu and integrate their accounts for information extraction. After this, they will be able to access their optimized calendar and converse with Ed.
2. Returning Students: Returning students do not need to undergo the onboarding process. Once they input their credentials, they will be able to view their optimized calendar and converse with Ed.
