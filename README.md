We begin our story with our hypothetical student Nick Ramen. Nick Ramen is a college student dealing with a situation a lot of us can empathize to: he wants to have the best college experience possible, all the while maintaining good grades, a healthy sleep schedule, and a social life. However, it comes to a point where he has overcommited and becomes overwhelmed, leading to a decline in grades and is lost as to how to navigate his academic decline.

Like Nick, approximtely 86% of college students face challenges in effectively managing their time, leading to procrastination, stress, and a decline in academic performance.

Here is how CogniEdu can help:

CogniEdu takes the planning out of these priorities and creates an optimized schedule, tailored according to the student‚Äôs preferences, skills and commitments. With CogniEdu, students have a dedicated AI Chatbot Assistant in Ed, a conversational AI chatbot as they navigate through their academic journey. Ed assists with organizing tasks, sending out email reminders, answering questions about their calendar and classes, and helping students be more successful with their academics.

### [üìã Onboarding Experience](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/1_API_Integrations) <a name="Onboarding-Experience"></a>
Each student undergoes an onboarding experience that integrates their calendar and academic platform through API calls. During this process, users complete an onboarding questionnaire that Ed uses to learn about their study habits and academic preferences. This information allows Ed to personalize the planning experience according to each student‚Äôs needs. 

<h5 align="center"> Onboarding </h5>
<p align="center">
<img width="485" alt="Onboarding" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/881a35f2-f323-4dc0-9331-21047dae264a">
</p>

### [üóÑÔ∏è Database Management with SQL](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/2_SQL_Database) <a name="Database"></a> 
Upon user signup, the onboarding questionnaire populates the student's table in MySQL. By integrating with the student's Google account, the application continuously syncs their Google Calendar event data with the MySQL database. 

<h5 align="center"> Calendar Sync Overview </h5>
<p align="center">
<img width="400" alt="Calendar Sync Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e418f9e5-2097-46da-8a15-bf9c5570982d">
</p> 

The calendar sync involves an initial import of the student's full calendar, while the continuous sync regularly updates every X number of minutes. The sync also stores events and handles NEW, UPDATED, and DELETED items chunked and embedded for future retrieval, per a logic. 

<h5 align="center"> Calendar Sync Logic </h5>

<img width="400" alt="Calendar Sync Overview" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69833ef1-ab3f-4bb3-8258-1be97508510e">
</p> 

The MySQL database also houses assignment information, such as due dates and instructions, which is extracted from Google Classroom, and then transformed, before being loaded into said database. The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application then leverages this comprehensive data set to provide personalized and optimized solutions.                                                
### [üïõ Time Estimations by LLM for Optimizer Algorithm](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/3_Time_Estimation_LLM) <a name="Time"></a> 
### Time Estimation

The time estimation algorithm serves as the preliminary phase in preparing data for the optimizer. This process is executed in two steps utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) through prompt engineering.

**Step 1: Assignment Difficulty Level**
The LLM evaluates the difficulty level of each assignment based on its content. Assignments are then categorized on a scale of easy, medium, or hard. These qualitative scales are converted into numerical values and stored accordingly.

**Step 2: Time Estimation**
Based on the assignment's content and its assigned difficulty level, the LLM estimates the time required to complete the assignment. Once the time estimation is determined, it is provided to the optimizer to create an optimized study plan.

<h5 align="center"> Time Estimation LLM </h5>

### [üóìÔ∏è Optimized Scheduling via Heuristics and LLM Prompting](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/4_Optimizer) <a name="Optimizing"></a> 
Leveraging Gemini‚Äôs advanced reasoning capabilities, our application generates a study schedule based on specified study durations (e.g., 2 hours, 4 hours). These durations are processed through a greedy heuristic optimization algorithm, which considers the student's availability and preferences. The algorithm strategically places these study sessions at optimal times throughout the day. The outcome is a comprehensive schedule that seamlessly integrates the student‚Äôs personal events with the newly optimized study times.

### [üí¨ Ed: Our Conversational AI Agent](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/5_Chatbot) <a name="Ed"></a> 
CogniEdu's chatbot, Ed, is built on the ReAct (Reasoning and Acting) paradigm, leveraging LangGraph to create a dynamic, multi-tool agent. The system employs three key capabilities:

1. PDF Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): This tool accesses and queries students' Google Classroom materials, providing efficient and relevant information from course documents.

2. Calendar Interaction: A dedicated tool enables conversational access to the student's personal and academic calendar, allowing for schedule queries and management.

3. Web Search Integration: Utilizing Tavily, the agent can fetch external resources to supplement course materials and provide additional learning support.

<h5 align="center"> ReAct Framework </h5>
<p align="center">
<img width="267" alt="ReAct Framework" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fb2feec-ee06-4b08-adfd-99872d1d76db">
</p> 

Ed processes user queries through an iterative cycle of reasoning (using a Large Language Model) and acting (employing these specialized tools). This ReAct architecture allows the agent to break down complex queries, determine the most appropriate tools to use, and synthesize information from multiple sources. By integrating these functionalities, students can seamlessly query their course resources, manage their schedules, and access relevant external content through natural language conversations. The LangGraph framework enables Ed to maintain context and make informed decisions throughout these interactions, enhancing the overall user experience and academic support.

<h5 align="center"> Ed's Pipeline </h5>
<p align="center">

### [üîî Proactive Alerts for On Task Management](https://github.com/Foroughmo/CogniEdu/tree/main/6_Email_Notification) <a name="Notifications"></a> 
Managing one's schedule effectively can often prove to be challenging. Ed sends email notifications with optimized calendar information to help users stay on track by extracting calendar data, formatting it into informative emails, and automating the process. Emails are securely sent by integrating with external email servers via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for safe message transmission.
