    "The score should also be based on the grading rubric below. \n",
    "\n",
    "Grading Rubric: {criteria}\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Correctness:\n",
    " - Definition: The response is accurate and includes information from the user's data. \n",
    " - Examples: The answer may be totally incorrect or partially correct depending on how much information from the user's data has been included. If the response correctly paraphrases or directly uses details from the reference, it scores higher. The response may include a logical hypothesis, such as answering the question based on other information that it is aware of about the answer (e.g., course knowledge). This is acceptable, as long as the response seems logical and is not trying to make it seem as though the information is directly from the user's data. If the Agent does not know the answer, then the score should be \"N/A\"\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Relevant:\n",
    " - Definition: The response directly addresses the question and stays within the scope of the user's data.\n",
    " - Examples: Providing relevant links or additional information pertinent to the user's query is considered relevant. Responses outside of the user's data may be irrelevant. However, the response may include information relevant, such as external links to help the user with their assignments. These types of information are relevant if they are related to the question.  \n",
    " \n",
    "3. Conciseness: \n",
    " - Definition: The response is succinct, avoiding unnecessary details or rambling.\n",
    " - Examples: The Agent may be synthesizing large amounts of data from the user's provided data. A brief and to-the-point answer that is easy to understand scores higher.\n",
    " \n",
    "4. Details:\n",
    " - Definition: The response includes pertinant details that fully answer the question. The most important details are those that answer the question in full. \n",
    " - Examples: Comprehensive answers that cover all aspects of the question will score higher.\n",
    " \n",
    "5. Helpfulness:\n",
    " - Definition: The response is helpful to the user in that it provides them with the information that they need and is encouraging.\n",
    " - Examples: Providing responses that answer the question is helpful. Additional resources, if applicable, when relevant can be helpful, too, but may not always be present in the answer.  \n",
    " \n",
    "6. Coherence:\n",
    " - Definition: The response has a logical structure, makes sense and is and easy to follow.  \n",
    " - Examples: Responses that are clear and organized score higher. \n",
    " \n",
    "7. Conduct:\n",
    " - Definition: The response is polite, non-offensive, and maintains a professional tone.\n",
    " - Examples: The Agent's response should NOT include any harmful, malicious, misogyny, criminal, or insensitive information, as that will reduce the score. \n",
    "\n",
    "8. Overall Score: \n",
    " - Definition: Based on the performance of the first 7 criterias, provide an overall score of the response. \n",
    " - Examples: The Agent's Overall Score should be high if they scored high in most, if not all, the categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "One key piece of information is that the Agent is supposed to be a helpfu AI assistant that supports university students by answering questions based on their data (i.e., user data). This data may include course materials or information from their calendars.\n",
    "\n",
    "Expected Response: {reference}\n",
    "1. The reference will include information from the user's data and can be used to compare with the Agent's response. \n",
    "2. The answer should perform well against the categories listed in the Grading Rubric. \n",
    "3. One example of a good response includes when a user asks about what they have to do for an assignment, the response should include details about the assignment that directly comes from their user data.The Agent's response may also include relevant links for the assignment. So, if the assignment is about conducting hypothesis testing, the links should concern that topic.  \n",
    "4. Don't make assumptions about what is or is not the accurate answer. The referance answer is the \"source of truth.\" \n",
